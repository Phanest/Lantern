# Lantern
A proof of concept for navigating web sites for the blind, by designing a UI using RDFa expressions. I suspect that in order for RDFa to be more widely used as an annotation device for designing UIs, it will have to become easier to use, as it is rather unfeasible to be used in such a way now.

This project contains:
- Lantern_IntroductionExample - An example site that guides the user though the features of Lantern, it is created in Django
- Lantern_ScreenReader - A Chrome extension which can navigate through a Lantern annotated site. Users should set the keyboard shortcuts before use as Chrome limits the number of default shortcuts.
